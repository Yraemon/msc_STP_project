# msc_STP_project

The code was used to generate a rate-based network model of excitatory pyramidal cells (PCs), inhibitory interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV-INs), and interneurons expressing somatostatin (SOM-INs).

For the model and related transfer function and perturbation protocols, see the folder "functions".

For instructions to run the model, see the Jupyter notebook "WC model".

For comparing the effect of different inital weights and learning rate, see "varying_w" and "varying_eta" provide respectively.
